  # Fix storage and profile policies

  1. Storage Setup
    - Create avatars bucket for user profile images
    - Set up proper RLS policies for avatar uploads

  2. Profile Policies
    - Ensure proper RLS policies for profiles table
    - Allow authenticated users to view all profiles
    - Allow users to manage their own profiles

  Note: Removed auth.uid() function creation as it's a built-in Supabase function
