/*
  # Storage and Profile Policies Setup

  1. Storage Configuration
    - Create avatars bucket for user profile images
    - Set up public access policies for avatar viewing
    - Configure authenticated user policies for avatar management

  2. Profile Policies
    - Enable public viewing of all profiles
    - Allow users to update their own profiles
    - Allow users to insert their own profiles

  3. Security
    - All policies use built-in auth.uid() function
    - Row Level Security enforced on profiles table
    - Storage policies restrict access appropriately
